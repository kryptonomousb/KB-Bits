# HardHat - Signing a Message using Ethers 6

VerifySignature.sol is from [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/signature/)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat signature use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test test/verifySignature_Test.ts
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```
